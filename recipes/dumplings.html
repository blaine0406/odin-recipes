        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>

        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gravy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the soup: Place chicken pieces in a large pot; add chicken stock, onions, celery, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, then simmer, partially covered, until chicken is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the dumplings: Beat egg and milk together in a large mixing bowl. Mix in 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt. Grate cold butter into the wet flour mixture; stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Dollop 6 large spoonfuls of dumpling mixture onto the top of the simmering chicken. Cover the pot and steam dumplings until fluffy, 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove dumplings and chicken pieces to a large dish; shred chicken and discard bones. Cover and set aside, keeping warm.</li>
        <li>For the gravy: Strain stock left in the pot, pressing the vegetables to release more flavor; return stock to the pot. Whisk water with remaining 1/2 cup flour until smooth; stir into the strained stock. Season with pepper and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, to thicken.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken and top with dumplings. Serve with parsley.</li>
